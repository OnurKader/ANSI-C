# A Practice Program in C

___

## About

Just learning the basics of pipes too hopefully, maybe add color support

Manipulating the terminal with `term.h (termios.h)`


## Installation and Usage

Run `make` then `make run` to run

Edit the Makefile, I'll add a `configure` script sometime in the future.
Edit the installation path to your liking and change the source path as well.

## Plans

I'll use it as NCURSES perhaps.

Make the CMP1001 project, a maze game with a controllable character who
is collecting bonuses.
